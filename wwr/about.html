            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Wild River Rafting was founded in 2015 by a group of outdoor enthusiasts 
                who shared a deep passion for rivers, nature, and adventure. 
                What started as a small operation with just one raft and a handful of local guides 
                has grown into one of the most trusted rafting companies in the region.
                Over the years, we've welcomed thousands of adventurers from around the world, 
                offering safe, thrilling, and eco-friendly river experiences. 
                Our team is made up of certified guides who are not only experts on the water 
                but also ambassadors of environmental stewardship and local culture.
                Driven by a love for the outdoors and a commitment to excellence, 
                Wild River Rafting continues to expand, 
                always staying true to its roots: creating meaningful experiences that connect people
                with the power and beauty of wild rivers.</p>
